## Summary of Veon et. al 

As human development continues to expand, wildlife species are increasingly forced to either relocate or adapt to survive in human abundant environments. Veon et al. (2023) examined how urbanization and top down predator presence influence the occupancy, abundance, and activity of the Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana). Species that successfully adapt to these human-dominated environments modify behaviors such as activity patterns, diets, and habitat use to exist in spaces that are often loud and bright. With these human-dominated environments also comes access to human-subsidized resources, such as supplemental food, water, and shelter sites (Veon et al., 2023). The researchers in this article aimed to understand whether opossums benefit from living near humans through access to human-subsidized resources or by experiencing reduced predation pressure. 

To investigate these dynamics, Veon et al. (2023) utilized data from Snapshot USA, a nationwide camera trapping project conducted in 2019 and 2020. They analyzed over 1,800 camera sites across 134 subprojects within the opossum’s geographic range in the United States. Each site recorded wildlife detections using motion-triggered cameras, and the data were used to estimate opossum occupancy, relative abundance, and activity patterns. Environmental variables such as forest cover, housing density, development intensity, and anthropogenic sound levels were measured within 500-meter buffers around each camera. Predator abundance was estimated from the detection of two major opossum predators, the coyote (Canis latrans) and bobcat (Lynx rufus) (Veon et al., 2023).

The researchers occupancy probability was best predicted by the interaction between anthropogenic sound and forest cover. The results showed that opossums were generally positively related to anthropogenic sound and negatively related to forest cover (Veon et al., 2023). However, in quieter, less disturbed areas, opossum presence declined with increasing forest cover, implying that they favored more developed areas where human influence was stronger, likely seeking human-provided resources or structures (Veon et al., 2023).
The researchers' abundance analysis showed a significant interaction between housing unit density and predator abundance. In areas with high housing density, both opossum and predator (coyote) detections increased, indicating that human-modified landscapes may support higher densities of both groups (Veon et al., 2023). However, at low or moderate HUD levels, opossum abundance showed minimal increase when predator abundance increased. The correlated increase in abundance of both predators and opossums suggests that opossums may receive some protection from living alongside humans, or that normal predator–prey interactions are disrupted in highly developed environments (Veon et al., 2023).
The researchers activity data showed that 91.7% of opossum detections occurred at night, confirming their nocturnal behavior (Veon et al., 2023). However, opossums in areas with higher predator abundance were observed closer to sunset. This suggests that they shifted activity to earlier hours, possibly to avoid peak predator activity later at night (Veon et al., 2023). 

In essence, Veon et al. (2023) concluded that humans and human development has influences on wildlife behavior and distribution. Opossums are more likely to occur in areas near people, benefiting from the resources, water, and shelter that humans intentionally or unintentionally provide. The study emphasized that urban ecosystems can also create complex ecological interactions that can alter traditional predator–prey relationships (Veon et al., 2023). These findings highlight the importance of considering human activity as a major ecological factor when studying wildlife populations. The researchers recommended future research to distinguish whether opossum success in urban areas is driven primarily by access to anthropogenic food sources or by reduced mortality from predator avoidance (Veon et al., 2023). As urban expansion continues, species like the Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana) serve as key models for understanding how adaptable mammals persist and thrive in the rapidly changing human developments (Veon et al., 2023).
