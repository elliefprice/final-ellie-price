## Sperm Adaptations in Deer Mice 

Sperm have many adaptations to increase their likelihood of fertilizing an egg. Scientists have found that one of these adaptations is cooperation, and that competition drives cooperation. This is present in a study of deer mice (Peromyscus maculatus). By forming cooperative groups (motile aggregations), sperm are able to increase their swimming velocity. 
Scientists looked at two related species of deer mice with different mating habits. The Promiscuous Mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), where females in this species mate with many different males. Resulting in  intense sperm competition. As well as The Monogamous Mouse (Peromyscus polionotus), where females in this species stick with one partner, so there is little to no sperm competition. In the promiscuous P. maniculatus, sperm were significantly more likely to aggregate with sperm from the same male than with sperm from an unrelated male of the same species (Fisher and Hoekstra, 2010). While sperm from the monogamous P. polionotus (which experiences little to no sperm competition) aggregated with sperm from unrelated males of their own species (Fisher and Hoekstra, 2010). 
Fisher and Hoekstra’s study also demonstrates that sperm can discriminate based on genetic relatedness. An experiment consisted of live sperm from male mice and its sister species to determine if the sperm are able to identify and group with related cells. When sperm from P. maniculatus and its sister species P. polionotus were mixed, they preferred to form groups with sperm from their own species (Fisher and Hoekstra, 2010). This was observed again with sibling sperm from P. maniculatus. When sperm from full-siblings were mixed, sperm still grouped with those from the same male rather than with those from a brother. However, when sperm from two different monogamous males were mixed, they formed groups with any other sperm from their species. 
In essence, the study reveals that the formation of sperm groups is shaped by sexual selection. This selection favors sperm that can identify and help their relatives to maximize the chances of passing on shared genes. Also, the aggregation of sperm in the monogamous P. polionotus may persist because it still offers benefits, such as faster travel through a female reproductive tract. Alternatively, sperm aggregation could be an ancestral trait that existed before the species diverged.
